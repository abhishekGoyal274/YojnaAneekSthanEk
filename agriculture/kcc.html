                <p class="lead">The Kisan Credit Card scheme is a Government of India scheme which provides farmers with timely access to credit. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme was launched in 1998 with the aim of providing short-term formal credit to farmers and
                    was created by NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development). The KCC scheme was introduced to ensure that the credit requirements for farmers in the agriculture, fisheries and animal husbandry sector were being met.
                    This was done by helping them avail short-term loans and provide them with a credit limit to purchase equipment and for their other expenses as well.

            <p class="lead">

                Moreover, with the help of KCC, farmers are exempt from the high interest rates of the regular loans offered by banks as the interest rate for KCC starts as low as 2% and averages at 4%. With the help of this scheme, farmers can repay their loans depending
                on the harvesting period of their crop for which the loan was given.
